<h1>Valtari</h1>
<p>
Valtari is the sixth full-length studio album by the Icelandic band 
Sigur R&#243;s, released on May 23, 2012 in Japan, and 
May 28 and 29 in most other territories.
</p>
<p>
The album was announced in an interview with Q Magazine on March 26, 2012. 
Bassist Georg H&#243;lm described the album as having "more electronic 
stuff than before" but not being "a dance album". The first single, 
"Ekki M&#250;kk", as well as an accompanying video, was released on 
the same day.
